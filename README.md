## Mentee Checkpoint 1 | Knowledge That I have Gained
1. Python, Built-Ins & Intermediate Concepts: I already had a solid understanding of Python, but through the provided resources, I further strengthened my knowledge. I revisited essential built-in packages such as collections, itertools, and datetime. Additionally, I refreshed my understanding of crucial concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), decorators, generators, and gained familiarity with threading and multiprocessing basics.
2. Python, External Packages & Libraries: I deepened my understanding of the NumPy package, with a specific focus on the power of vectorization. I also delved into the fundamentals of data cleaning and manipulation using pandas, mastering techniques for efficient data processing. Furthermore, I explored Matplotlib for creating various types of graphs and gained proficiency in customizing them to meet specific requirements.
3. Machine Learning: I successfully completed Andrew Ng's Coursera course on "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification." The course provided comprehensive knowledge of regression techniques (including univariate, multivariate, linear, and logistic regression) and their applications in prediction and classification tasks.
  Currently, I am in the process of learning about Naive Bayes and Perceptron models.
